Brief History:

Aanmitaagzi has grown from a convergence of the personal and professional histories of its core members, while remaining true to the initial vision of its co-founders, Penny Couchie and Sid Bobb. When Penny and Sid moved to Penny's ancestral home of Nipissing First Nation in 2006, they welcomed the possibility of living and working as professional artists to support a thriving arts community in Nipissing and the surrounding communities. They recognized the benefits of developing and maintaining relationships and partnerships with like-minded groups, and the potential for Nipissing to become a home for research, development, and the creation of new works in dance, theatre, and cross-disciplinary arts with both professional and community artists.


Following the success of their first community engaged arts project, Stories of Nipissing, and with positive feedback and support from the community, Penny and Sid formed the Aanmitaagzi Collective with Carol Guppy and Perry McLeod Shabogeesic in 2008. In 2009, after conducting strategic outreach in Bear Island / Temagami, Sherry Guppy and Bonnie Couchie also joined the company. Identifying the need for a strong organizational foundation for the future of the company, Aanmitaagzi sought out capacity building initiatives, including a mentorship in organizational development with Ruth Howard of Jumblies Theatre funded through the OAC Compass program and Canada Council for the Arts' Capacity Building program. Aanmitaagzi incorporated as a provincial, not-for-profit organization in October 2010, and continues to engage the local community through multi-disciplinary and multi-generational arts activities and cultural events.","161 Couchie Memorial Drive

Awesome Arts is a rich program that allows participants of all ages to explore global issues through the arts. Held in partnership with after-school school programs, organizations and community centres, Awesome Arts is an exciting series of workshops culminating in a public celebration. During Awesome Arts, participants express themselves via various art forms such as slam poetry, animation, music, theatre and video, all the while exploring important issues. Awesome Arts participants share their talents at a final performance, which can also feature professional artists, inspiring the entire community to remain connected with the arts and the issues. 



To date Awesome Arts and its French program Arts en folie has been run in a number of communities around Ottawa with a variety of partners, including 6 consecutive years in Lowertown and twice in Sandy Hill. Awesome Arts has provided 660 individual workshops to 1200 children, youth and seniors. Awesome Arts Festivals have featured performances from over 700 children, youth and seniors and 65 local professional artists to over 5275 Ottawa residents.



After a five-year history with One World Arts, Awesome Arts moved to MASC's banner as of July 1, 2013.

SENIORS PROGRAM



Since 2009, MASC has been serving up the arts to seniors in Ottawa-Gatineau with programming featuring talented artists, an enthusiastic group of individuals and ensembles who entertain, educate and enlighten. MASC artists are professional musicians, visual and video artists, writers, storytellers, actors and dancers. Each offers a unique artistic activity to seniors, bringing opportunities for hands-on participation in engaging workshops or as an audience for thrilling, multi-cultural performances.



Participants speak of learning new skills, widening their understanding of other cultures and the excitement of finding a creative ability.  Performances and discussions with the artists afterwards have proved an exceptional experience for both participants and performers.  For example, a presentation by Aboriginal Experiences inspired the following comment by the organizer: ""Our oldest member, aged 95, was most eager to join in the friendship dance and quite a few audience members danced on stage with the performers.  This kind of interactive performance really connected with them.""



MASC's Seniors Program brings professional artists in all disciplines to work with seniors in homes, centres and hospitals, offering experiences in the arts through performances, workshops and residencies.  MASC programs are offered at a subsidized rate, with priority given to organizations who work with low-income seniors, or who have limited budgets for arts programming.

CANVAS programs cover an assortment of topics, including body esteem, gender identity, sexual orientation, consent, healthy relationships and the effect of social media. Each workshop culminates with the creation of an arts-based social action project that can be shared with the wider community. Our unique youth programs are intended to be run in schools, camps and community centres. The programs are designed to fit the needs of each different environment and group of young people; the length, focus and depth vary between programs.

Creating spaces where young people can engage in their rightful task of identity construction and culture making within a space that embraces and celebrates their spiritual, cultural and holistic self-representation. Where young people and elders share intergenerational knowledge on reclaiming ancestral wisdom, exploring gift economies, culture making and creative entrepreneurship.



Engaging young people, diverse artists and communities to create, perform and exhibit art about issues that impact their lives.



Creating spaces for the community to support the daily struggles where oppression manifests while building capacities and imaginations to create a better world.  Where community can celebrate, grieve, and build relationships that enhance individual power and collective change.

Since 1999, The Festival has attracted over 14,000 patrons. We present over 25 entertaining and thought provoking films of all genres that otherwise may not be presented in Calgary. Our innovative programming ensures that film leaps from the screen to the lived experience, through panels, Q&As; and other related events. We show local, national and international work with opportunities for filmmakers, audiences and emerging audiences to engage, network and grow.



Fairy Tales also delivers the year-round OUTReels Diversity Education Program. OUTReels provides diversity education to the communities around Calgary by using filmmaking and other art forms as educational vehicles. Screenings have included: Miscellaneous Youth Group, Queers on Campus, Alliance to End Violence, Calgary Public Library (Fish Creek, Central and Louise Reily branches), Hillhurst United Church, and St. Stephen's Anglican Church. OUTReels features films that generate conversations on topics such as bullying, the intersection between religion and sexuality, queer history and the global struggle for human rights worldwide.



In 2011, Fairy Tales also launched two new programs: Q the Arts, and the Youth Queer Media Program (YQMP). The YQMP mentors youth in creating a first film, video or animation addressing issues faced by Queer Youth today. Each year, YQMP work is elegible to be selected as part of the YQMP screening Gala, held as part of the annual Fairy Tales Queer Film Festival anually. Q the Arts began as an annual festival event at the Arrata Centre in March 2011, showcasing queer artists through performance, music, spoken word, and visual arts.

Young females participate in a two days per week breaking workshop, engage in discussions surrounding women (in Hip-Hop) and attend dance events-all in a supportive and safe environment.  This program is about preserving of the art B-girling and creating a new generation of Toronto B-girls who are committed to exploring their individuality and creativity.



While there are a growing number of B-Girls internationally and across Canada, there are still very few in the Toronto B-Boy/B-Girl community. TB-GM/MB-GM is a free, intensive 12-24 month program to support young women with a strong desire to learn about B-Girling (aka break-dancing/breaking).  The girls partake in intensive training and knowledge development sessions, putting their new skills to work by participating in community events and competitions, and working towards a final event where they demonstrate their skills and celebrate women in Hip Hop.  Every week, training is complemented with food and discussions surrounding the history of Hip Hop culture, the status of local Hip Hop scene, and gender issues among the Hip Hop community.  TB-GM also hosts a weekly practice session Sunday nights from 7:30-9pm.   It is open to the public ($2 entry), to provide an open and inclusive practice space and to foster engagement and exchange with the wider community of B-Boys and B-Girls.  To develop leadership, we will grant participants with opportunities to lead workshops and share ideas and concepts amongst their peers.



Within months of establishing the group, KeepRockinYou was already opening up space for women in ciphers across Ontario, organizing a women's break demo at Manifesto Festival of Community and Culture, representing for women at the House of Paint Festival, at World of Dance, organizing  community events and battles in Toronto and Montreal, doing stage shows with Supernaturalz b-boy crew, and joining the UNITY Charity artist training sessions.  Most recently TB-GM has collaborated with an intergenerational group of dance artists under the direction of Kaeja d'Dance, performing a B-Girling choreography piece for Stability in Transition at the Montgomery's Inn.",keeprockingyou@gmail.com,"Judi ""Julo"" Lopez, Founder; Program Director","KeepRockinYou (KRY) is a community-based artists' collective that inspires females through Hip Hop culture, generating new avenues for them to grow, become empowered and be true to themselves.

The AMY Spring Theatre Creation Program is our flagship activity, a 14-week performance creation program offered each spring to young women and non-binary youth between 14 and 22 years of age. There are two components to the program. First, each participant works one-on-one with a professional artist mentor. Second, the group of participants works collectively with a team of professional directors and other guest artists to devise an original full-length play based on their own stories. The show they create receives three public showings at Canadian Stage. The group also shares a weekly meal and has many opportunities to attend pays and performances in Toronto. Participants receive honoraria, professional headshots, and volunteer hours..

We are in need of people who are willing to promote the project and connect remote schools with AFAP so we can put them on the list of recipients for upcoming initiatives, and of course, we are always in need of new and gently used art supplies.

In the long-term, this development will be fostered within multi-disciplinary artistic environments. Through group dynamics and methodologies, youth from diverse backgrounds will be encouraged to share their work with each other and with the public.
