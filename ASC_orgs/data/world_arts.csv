"Denver Arts and Venues","Denver Arts & Venues is the city’s local art government agency that seeks to enrich the community of Denver through supporting public venues, the arts, and entertainment.  The agency is responsible for the operation of some of the Denver area’s most popular and important cultural venues, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre, the Denver Performing Arts Complex, Denver Coliseum, the Colorado Convention Center and McNichols Civic Center Building. In addition to this, the agency invests in creative industries, arts and cultural districts, a robust Public Art program, arts education, and cultural events such as the Five Points Jazz Festival and Youth One Book, One Denver. Recently, Denver Arts & Venues has been working to implement IMAGINE 2020, a cultural plan which is intended to guide the city’s artistic, cultural, creative, and engagement efforts. IMAGINE 2020 includes a diversity, equity, and inclusiveness (DEI) initiative which serves as a framework for the entirety of the plan’s and agency’s efforts. One of the highlights of this initiative is a collaboration with the Human Rights & Community Partnerships Commissions for a new funding program in partnership with the African American Commission, Latino Commission, American Indian Commission, Asian American Pacific Islander Commission, Commission for People with Disabilities, Women’s Commission, Commission on Aging, Immigrant & Refugee Commission, and LGBTQ Commission. Through this program, Denver Arts & Venues provides funding to each commission which then directs how the funding will be invested in the represented community. The only guideline is that the project must incorporate arts, culture or creativity, in whichever way the community defines this. This is an opportunity for historically marginalized communities to take the lead and for Denver Arts & Venues to rethink their approach to funding and grantmaking. The organization has been a member of Americans for the Arts for 28 years. As a host for the 2018 Americans for the Arts Conference in Denver, Denver Arts & Venues was able to amplify their important, locally-focused work and role as leaders in the arts. The convention also allowed Denver Arts & Venues to showcase its city and state, as well as the agency’s commitment to arts and culture through support of community art organizations, artists and creatives, and partnerships with other sectors that amplify the arts through community building and social justice. Over the course of its membership to Americans for the Arts, Denver Arts & Venues has utilized its benefits to connect and learn from colleagues and professionals across the globe. The organization also takes advantage of the professional development benefits, such as webinars, resources provided via the bookstore, and affinity groups. Denver Arts & Venues is committed to enhancing the city of Denver through its continued support of arts and entertainment accessible to all.","United States"

"Cuyahoga Arts & Culture","Ten years after Cuyahoga Arts & Culture (CAC) made its first grant, the public agency based in Cleveland, Ohio has invested $158 million in 350 arts and culture nonprofits and funded more than 160 individual artists in Northeast Ohio, making CAC the largest funder of arts and culture in the region. From the world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, to groups of neighbors coming together to build a community garden, Cuyahoga Arts & Culture supports the activities and organizations that connect community to arts and culture. CAC is a local arts agency, and believes that local arts agencies have a special place in our nation’s arts ecology as connectors: between institutions, artists, and residents. After the 30-cent-per-pack cigarette tax that funds CAC’s work was overwhelmingly renewed by voters in November 2015, the agency set out to better understand: how can it best support the creative life of all Cuyahoga County residents now, and for years to come? Since CAC stewards public dollars, the question of creating more equitable support for—and access to—arts and culture was central to this work. Community-wide listening was carried out through a convening of CAC-funded organizations, an online survey, street-level surveys completed by trained volunteers at 18 community events, and eight focus groups with 175 area residents. CAC knew it was important to capture voices that hadn’t been heard before, so its outreach happened at places such as downtown homeless shelters, public health centers, farmers’ markets in the suburbs, and community festivals, as well as at more mainstream arts events. The results culminated into the report, Cuyahoga Voices & Vision, which used data from Americans for the Arts sources to holistically analyze the results of the report. Our planning and listening led us to craft a vision that will guide our next ten years: all Cuyahoga County residents experience a meaningful cultural life.  And guided by that vision, and a set of values that includes equity, the agency will more deeply engage the community and explore ways to equitably support organizations and people who may have been left out of the process in the past. As a member of Americans for the Arts, CAC consistently leverages AFTA research, attends network-expanding conferences and workshops, and benefits from connections built within the AFTA community. With these resources, and a focus on more equitable grant making, CAC will continue to work to ensure all Cuyahoga County residents can connect to and see themselves in the region’s vibrant arts and cultural community.","United States"

"Arts at Large","As a Co-Founder of Arts @ Large, I have attended numerous Americans for the Arts conferences where my national network has grown.

"Leeann Wallett","My membership with Americans for the Arts has helped me see my potential as a leader in the arts marketing sector. It led me to pursue my lifelong dream to attend graduate school abroad, living and studying in Dallas, Montréal, Bogotá, and Milan. My experiences in this graduate program allowed me to learn from leaders in international cultural management, visit well-known cultural institutions and facilities, and pursue my career in arts marketing. The knowledge gained brought me to my current position and has set me on a course to a bright future as a lifelong member of Americans for the Arts.

In addition, the exhaustive network of resources—arts advocates, in-depth research, nationwide conventions—is invaluable to me and the communities I serve. As the Program Officer, Communications and Marketing for the Delaware Division of the Arts, I have the privilege of leading and coordinating our overall communication, marketing and advertising strategies. Working in the second smallest state has its benefits. I have the unique ability to travel through all three counties—New Castle, Kent, and Sussex—in approximately two hours, which allows me to visit arts organizations of all sizes, shapes, and artistic disciplines from the Grand Opera House to the Dover Art League to the Freeman Stage.

My membership has always been invaluable to me and my career. I am a proud member of Americans for the Arts and am excited by the ability to share the arts throughout Delaware and nationwide.","United States"

"Metro Arts Nashville: Creativity for All in Music City","The city of Nashville, Tennessee, is sometimes referred to as the Athens of the South, a thriving hub of arts and culture with a diverse population and a world-famous music scene. At the forefront of the city’s cultural blossoming is a longtime member of Americans for the Arts, the Metropolitan Nashville Arts Commission, or Metro Arts. Metro Arts has a vision for every Nashvillian to participate in a creative life, and with population growth of a quarter million predicted over the next two decades, the commission is looking ahead to prepare Nashville’s cultural scene for the future. They believe that the arts are the key to a vibrant community culture, a strong creative workforce, and the spread of equity & inclusion. Through community-driven projects, education and partnerships, Metro Arts is working to bring access to the arts to everyone in Nashville.

In 2015, Metro Arts partnered with the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce to survey the arts & culture landscape and identify opportunities for cultural planning. The resulting report, Culture Here, details the broad extent of the city’s cultural impact on community and the local economy. More than 5,000 arts-related organizations and activities present their work in the Nashville area, and the music industry alone contributes more than $10 billion to the local economy. Metro Arts supports these organizations through projects like the THRIVE community arts funding program, Poetry in Motion, Artober Nashville, ExploreNashville-Art.com, and more. Additionally, it offers workshops, training and other resources for practicing artists. As part of its mission of a creative life for all, Metro Arts also invests in community arts with annual grants to local arts organizations. This year, the organization awarded more than $2 million in funding to support arts creation, access and education from local nonprofits.

Last year, Metro Arts also brought forward a new five-year strategic plan, Crafting a Creative City, which lays out new objectives for supporting Nashville’s creative life. Goals outlined in the report include increasing resources for the creative ecosystem, cultivating equity, and improving local creative infrastructure. This year, the commission is working to develop one key strategy in particular, a Public Art Community Investment Plan. The ten-month planning process is bringing together artists and community stakeholders for a conversation about the future of public art in Nashville. At least 44 public art works have been funded by the city’s Percent for Art fund, which allocates money for public art as a percentage of capital improvement projects.

To kick-start the creation of impactful public art projects, this year Metro Arts launched its inaugural Learning Lab training program for local artists. This professional development program is designed to train artists in civic, public, social, and placemaking practices, which will help develop community understanding and pave the way for neighborhood activation through the arts. Once the artists complete the program, they will be eligible for up to $5,000 in funding for temporary neighborhood art projects around the city. Twenty-five Nashville artists were selected to take part in the first Learning Lab, which will run from June through October, 2016. Through this unique program, Metro Arts is preparing a new cohort of artists to spread creativity throughout their communities, moving one step closer to a creative life for all.","United States"

"The Rose Kennedy Greenway","Public Art Meets Boston’s Contemporary Park

In 1991, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority began one of the most challenging and substantial changes to the Boston landscape, the Central Artery/Tunnel project, or the Big Dig. Although this project eventually succeeded in easing downtown traffic congestion, the Big Dig put Boston into a state of upheaval for almost sixteen years. Despite all of their trials, the city, state, MTA, and various civic groups came together to create something new: a park that would cover over the scar of the old Central Artery and open up new space for Boston residents. The Greenway, stretching from New Sudbury Street in the North End to Beach Street in Chinatown, re-connected old neighborhoods that were once separated by the elevated highway. Inaugurated in 2008 and named for Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the Rose Kennedy Greenway is an important part of the city’s efforts to reinvent Boston in the 21st century. The Greenway has helped beautify the city, encourage a sense of community and create civic space. Today the park is home to water features, food trucks, free public Wi-Fi, a carousel, free events and a public art program. This little ribbon of green is a refuge for urban residents, a place for recreation and social interaction.

In 2012, the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy began the process of creating a strategic plan for its public art program after seeing its potential to spark the city’s imagination, connect neighborhoods, contribute to economic health and inspire civic interaction. The result of this was a five-year strategy entitled Public Art on the Greenway, an initiative to bring innovative art to Boston through free, temporary exhibitions by contemporary artists. The vision for this new program was inspired by four conceptual frameworks: Connection: Projects that unite the segmented parks and connect the individual communities along the Greenway. Interactivity: Projects that engage visitors with the park and one another. Civic Dialogue: Projects that highlight freedom of expression, freedom of speech, diversity, and other civic and community issues. Ecology and the Environment: Projects that deal directly with issues of sustainability and the environment. Already, the new public art initiative is attracting attention. Earlier this spring, the Conservancy unveiled a new installation of twelve bronze animal heads fashioned by famed Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads represents the twelve traditional figures of the Chinese Zodiac, cast into huge animal heads that weigh upwards of 1,000 pounds. On a worldwide tour with stops in London, Paris and New York, Ai Weiwei’s exhibit is now featured on the Greenway through October 2016. In the park, the sculptures are positioned around the Rings Fountain, where Bostonians are invited to splash and cool off in the summer heat. This exhibit, however, has a more serious side; in creating these sculptures, the artist wanted to highlight the global issue of the looting of cultural antiquities. By featuring contemporary artists like Lawerence Weiner, Carolina Aragon and Gianna Stewart, the Greenway is spearheading Boston’s growing identity as a creative community and an artistic powerhouse.","United States"

"Chris McLeod","As an advertising agency-trained strategic arts marketing consultant who has worked with both companies and government entities such as ExxonMobil and the Department of Defense, I was confident that I had a lot to bring to the Arts world.  I love the Arts and so far I have provided private consulting services to many arts agencies and organizations on matters such as reaching and engaging underserved communities. But what I have valued most is that being a member of Americans for the Arts has helped me utilize my marketing expertise towards projects and initiatives that have enabled me to grow as well as make an impact on people in their everyday lives.
 
My work and passion for marketing led me to be asked to join the faculty of the National Arts Marketing Project (NAMP). Now, in addition to privately consulting with arts organizations I also travel to various cities and meet with groups of arts marketers to share effective solutions for challenges such as building audiences and driving awareness. Doing this work has not only stretched my knowledge of the ever-changing marketing landscape, but it has also made me learn about the social and economic trends that affect how people engage with the Arts in their communities. I am happy and proud to be a member of Americans for the Arts and look forward to working with more arts agencies and organizations, helping them use strategic marketing techniques to successfully enrich, enlighten, and empower their cities and neighborhoods.

"Lucy M. F. Keshavarz","From a young age I have always felt that everything is interconnected and that the arts are just as much a part of the human psyche as is science, math and the need for food and shelter. What I love about the folks at Americans for the Arts is they get this. As an artist busy pursuing integrated public art, ecological art and studio work, I rely on Americans for the Arts to help me stay connected to the larger world of art and culture as well as fighting for the arts in the political arena.  Their research, advocacy and programming give me the tools I need to help me stay connected and my work relevant.

"Create CA: A Blueprint for Creative Schools","California’s statewide arts education coalition, Create CA, is a new collective impact organization focusing on advancing arts and education through multiple initiatives, partnerships, and projects. These programs include Creativity at the Core—professional learning modules for teachers to incorporate creativity into the Common Core curriculum requirements—and the Arts Ed Data Project, a part of the National Arts Ed Data Project that seeks to gather information on the status and condition of arts education across the country. The data will be analyzed and disseminated by each participating state to support arts advocacy and creative education in state education systems. Their mission is to bring high quality arts education to each California student every day and provide each student with the skills and education to become an essential part of the creative workforce.

Create CA’s most recent project, A Blueprint for Creative Schools, results from the work of over 100 contributors over two years studying the influence of the arts in education at every level. The blueprint lays out a strategic plan for incorporating the arts into curriculum across the state, supported by national data and research. The plan displays the importance of equity and access of arts education, while incorporating the four C’s of 21st century learning into the education policy: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.

The seven focus areas of the blueprint include:

Supporting the arts curriculum
Enhancing educator quality, preparation and professional learning in the arts
Producing high quality arts assessment, research, and evidence
Ensuring equity and access
Strengthening collaborative partnerships
Expanding the role of business and industry in the creative workforce
Providing funding for the arts
Some of the recommendations presented by the Blueprint include creating a 21st century model for visual and performing arts standards and curriculum, developing an arts report card public reporting system for school districts, and forming data collection mechanisms to review and address equity and access when implementing the suggested arts policies. These recommendations are just a few of the many recommendations set forth by the Blueprint to improve arts education in California.

On March 3rd and 4th, Create CA and the Fresno County Office of Education co-hosted a new statewide summit on arts, education, and the economy with presentations from local leaders, updates on Create CA projects, and motivating keynote speeches by Yvette Jackson, Nirvan Mullick, and Robert B. Morrison. Multiple sessions were held throughout the two-day summit regarding topics such as collaborative art, incorporation of STEAM, equal access to the arts for students, professional development in the arts, and much more.","United States"

"Shannon Daut","I have long valued my membership with Americans for the Arts. A couple of years ago, Bob Lynch came to Alaska for the National Lieutenant Governors Association meeting, and we at the Alaska State Council on the Arts (ASCA) hosted a variety of community meetings and receptions with him during his visit. One of these meetings was with the director of the Alaska Travel Industry Association (ATIA), where we discussed a Cultural Tourism Resolution that Americans for the Arts presented and had approved by the Lt. Governors Association. Because of this initial work, in the ensuing years ASCA adapted the cultural tourism resolution for the state which was later adopted by ATIA resulting in a cultural tourism chapter in 2015. We now have a framework to strengthen and enhance Alaskas cultural tourism efforts, which would not have happened without our membership!","United States"

From my first time visiting Capitol Hill as a part of Arts Advocacy Day to the honor of speaking at a plenary session of last years Annual Convention in Chicago, Americans for the Arts has provided a critical space for me to connect with peers in the field, learn from incredible mentors, and find my own voice as a leader.","United States"

"Kaiser Permanente Educational Theatre Program & Oregon Children’s Theatre","Since the early 1980s, Kaiser Permanente, a national nonprofit health care provider, has used its Educational Theatre Program (ETP) to model positive behaviors and healthy decision making to improve the health of the communities it serves across the country.

The use of theatre to inspire and educate children and adolescents to lead healthier lifestyles is so ingrained in Kaiser Permanente’s culture that all of its regions run their own ETP.

One region in particular has seen dramatic increases in its program and has been able to get its key messages in-front of a receptive target audience over the years thanks in part to an 11 year partnership with a respected local theatre company, Oregon Children’s Theatre (OCT).

The Northwest region’s partnership with Oregon Children’s Theatre first began in 2004 after Nancy Stevens, the Northwest region’s Director of Community Benefit, was hired and inherited its dormant ETP. Determined to reinvigorate the program but lacking the theatre experience needed to run it, she sought out the help of Stan Foote, a former Northwest ETP actor, who was working as the artistic director of Oregon Children’s Theatre.  Stan, soon after, proposed that their organizations partner to get the program up and running.

Oregon Children’s Theatre would supply its artistic staff (actors, playwrights, etc.) to produce the shows and would use its existing relationships with schools to bring ETP’s plays to students throughout the Northwest. This partnership allowed the ETP to get its message across to its target audiences, produce original, relevant and high quality shows and to get into schools relatively quickly. Original productions created by OTC for the Northwest ETP were also performed by ETPs in other Kaiser Permanente regions.

Kaiser Permanente in return would provide OCT with the funding the company needed to hire full time actors as teaching artists as well as the funding to travel to schools that were unable to afford to send their students to theatrical productions. The partnership also provided the theatre with visibility and access to audiences that it might have otherwise lacked.

Both ETP Northwest and OCT’s programs have expanded in recent years. OCT visits approximately 175 schools each year and has reached a cumulative audience of more than 270,000 students and families with its health-focused productions since it began offering its ETP programming. OCT has also begun offering intensive artist-in- residence programs in which its actor-educators are embedded in classrooms, creating productions with students, and directing performances by students, for students.

For 30 years, theatre has proven its value in helping Kaiser Permanente promote healthy life styles in the communities the company serves. Kaiser Permanente has even come to view it’s ETP as a way of providing an additional benefit to its communities. OCT also gets the morale boost that comes from using its theatrical skills to promote the public good","United States"

"Rachna Sheth","Americans for the Arts and I share a common vision: we both see arts as the solution. The value of art in our everyday lives is what brought me to my job as Marketing and PR Coordinator at Silk Road Rising, where I was a patron before I was an employee. As someone with artistic and arts education training who is new to arts marketing, I am especially grateful to Americans for the Arts for awarding me with a Field Diversity Scholarship Award to attend the National Arts Marketing Project Conference (NAMPC) 2015 and further my professional development. The sessions provided me with a framework to accomplish my goals. They helped to light the path between where I am and where I want to be. NAMPC encouraged me to ask more questions, even when the questions are difficult ones. How can we reach new audiences? How can we feel less intimidated by Google Analytics? How do we, as a theatre company that counters negative representation, continue conversations about disparity that actually lead to action? The conference provided me with a springboard to begin meaningful conversations and rekindled my passion for the arts.

When you are part of a small non-profit arts organization, wrapped up daily in the particulars that bring performance art to the stage, sometimes you forget you’re also part of a much larger arts community where there are people who have been in your shoes and whom you can learn from. NAMPC allowed me to network and develop my arts leadership skills and reminded me the importance of nurturing relationships. Moreover, it gathered leaders and movers and shakers in the arts marketing community under one roof so we could all see that yes, our goals are attainable. So while we are in our offices and communities doing our parts, it’s good to know that Americans for the Arts is out there on a national level, advocating for the arts so that we continue to have a place in the bigger picture, so people know that our everyday work is valuable and contributes to the betterment of the health and the enrichment of the lives of many Americans.","United States"

"Wormfarm Institute","Every fertile grain of soil, according to Charles Darwin, has passed at least once through the gut of an earthworm.  These literally subversive creatures have inspired cofounders Donna Neuwirth and Jay Salinas to explore what it takes to create a fertile environment - both in the dirt and in the arts.  Formed in 2000 as an artist residency program located on a working farm, the Wormfarm Institute has expanded programs regionally to connect urban and rural, people and land, culture and agriculture.

Fermentation Fest – A Live Culture Convergence is the most high-profile project. Each October this rural farming community celebrates live culture in all its forms from dance to yogurt, poetry to sauerkraut. Its signature feature is the Farm/Art DTour a 50-mile self-guided drive through scenic working farmlands of Sauk County, WI, punctuated with temporary art installations, pasture performances, roadside poetry and more. It draws thousands from both urban and rural areas to take a fresh look at farmland and see what else might be growing.

Fermentation is about abundance and transformation says Executive Director Neuwirth   from grain to beer, milk to cheese,  cabbage to kimchi - we take the season’s abundance and through a series of timely actions, ancient wisdom and natural processes, make it last. It’s also a rich metaphor for community transformation.

Community support has been broad and deep with county government, chambers of commerce, agriculture, tourism and economic development all playing significant roles. The small towns that the DTour passes though can’t ignore the economic impact and new arts organizations have formed.

Co-founder Salinas adds Fermentation Fest is an ambitious project. It has only been possible because we’ve been building fertility slowly over many years. The work began, and continues with our artist residency program. Every year we witness artists experience the parallels between making art and growing food, and how involvement in one feeds the other.

Along the 50 mile DTour, art amplifies existing assets and creates dynamic new relationships across diverse sectors. Farmers, artists, writers, conservationists, chefs, and educators through their varied perspectives and abilities contribute to a thriving rural culture that inspires more cultural activity, attracts travelers, draws new residents, provides economic growth, builds pride of place, and serves as a model for other rural communities. By revaluing the role of the farmer and the artist, expanding both the reach of and the appetite for the arts, Fermentation Fest increases collaboration across sectors. This polycultural approach can raise the profile and the allure of agricultural regions as places where important work is done, where creativity can and does flourish, and where livings - in the truest sense - can be made.

Neuwirth elaborates: We find ourselves at a moment in time when rural places are being reconsidered and revalued. Interest in sustainable and local food is growing quickly. Urban folks are hungry to deepen their connection to the land and technology has helped break down rural isolation. Across disciplines and geographies, we are part of a growing movement creating a new narrative of rural experience.

Rural America is undergoing a period of dramatic cultural and demographic change. Such developments call for our attention and creative action. For thousands of years farmers in cultures around the world interwove dance, music, and art through rituals of planting and the harvest in celebration of the land and those who care for it. Our hybrid projects present an opportunity reach thousands of people – and to do what art alone can do - inspire and open doors to new ways of seeing.","United States"

"Felix Padrón Director, City of San Antonio, Department for Culture & Creative Development","Being a member of Americans for the Arts is a valuable asset because it is the only advocacy organization in the country that is championing a diverse portfolio of cultural issues and initiatives to ensure that all Americans connect to the arts in a meaningful way. In the areas of arts education, the critical role the arts play in community development, as well as health and wellness with a great focus on well being of our military, and public support for the arts. Americans for the Arts also plays a key role in developing public and private strategic partnerships to build a stronger voice for the arts, providing key research to support better positioning that the arts are an economic strength.  Lastly, Americans for the Arts plays a strong role in professional development by providing training and research to the field.

It has given me greater access to a dynamic group of professionals and thought leaders that are as equally passionate about the arts as I am.  It has also expanded a much broader perspective on the complex cultural context we operate in. I think that it has really helped shape my conversation to where it is more informed and robust. Understanding the issues that stem from a broad national understanding and perspective.  It also gives me a higher-level credibility when having those conversations, specifically in a political environment or when tough issues are being debated.  Especially in an advocacy context, having Americans for the Arts by your side is a tremendous asset when talking to our federal, state, and local political leaders. It really makes a positive impact.","United States"

"Jon Hinojosa","As the Artistic & Executive Director of SAY Sí, an award-winning creative youth development program for students in San Antonio, TX, I work collaboratively with a committed team to change young lives through art. At first glance, it would seem like we are simply teaching our students how to make art.

Reciprocal learning is the foundation of our program, and we use that mindset in the work that we do outside of SAY Sí as well. Through Americans for the Arts' creative network, my staff and I get to work with artists, arts administrators, and lawmakers to meet national standards of excellence, and then raise those standards. As an Americans for the Arts member, I have been given more opportunities to lead, teach, share, and learn. The biggest part of (all of) our success lies in collaboration.

"Jackson Hole Public Art","Through August 19-21, 2015 the community of Jackson Hole, Wyoming is welcome to participate in an event along North Cache Street, a major roadway connecting downtown Jackson Hole to the country’s National Parks. The event - which will feature interactive art installations, performances and food vendors- will allow members of the community to interact, test, and provide input on public art prototypes proposed for the roadway. They can submit feedback by way of a Mobile Design Studio, a trailer stationed at the location and retrofitted with iPads, laptops, and design boards to enable community engagement.

The North Cache Place of Possibility event (North Cache POP) will be the second creative placemaking event hosted by Jackson Hole Public Art, the community’s public art program. Additonally, several future creative placemaking exercises are scheduled to occur across the community where capital improvement projects are planned. POP events are designed to transform every day locations, to get members of the community to think about how they interact in and use space, and are designed to encourage the community to reimagine these locations for what they can be as places of infinite and unrealized possibility.

These events are one of the many ways Jackson Hole Public Art keeps its residents at the center of its public art and creative placemaking efforts. As an organization that’s committed to enhancing public space by integrating art that celebrates the community’s unique environmental and cultural heritage, it understands that the culture of the community is inextricably tied to the people who live there and it relies on its interactions with the public to make sure those values, stories, and cultural traditions are captured or represented in the artwork it commissions. To help facilitate conversations around community planning and development Jackson Hole Public Art focuses on design as seen with the creation of POP events and the Mobile Design Studio.

This focus on design allows for more authentic interactions with the community and can also be seen in the organization’s work with youth especially in the launch of its Building STEAM program. The Building STEAM program uses public art design to engage youth as they learn key concepts associated with S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). The incorporation of design adds an artistic component or the A, creating S.T.E.A.M.

Building STEAM was developed after Bland Hoke, the current public artist on staff, identified an opportunity to work with high school students participating in fabrication labs at Jackson Hole High School. During weekly interventions in the labs, Hoke assisted with teaching the students 21st Century skills (communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity) and empowered the students to think about creative solutions to the design and construction of public art projects. They focused on the teen wing of the town’s local library and public seating for a vertical greenhouse in the community. This work not only allowed the students to apply what they learned to the real world, but also they were able to play a role in improving their community - making it more vibrant and appealing to fellow community members who would use these spaces.  

Another way Jackson Hole Public Art keeps the community and the artists at the center of its creative placemaking efforts is through its new public artist on staff program. The public artist on staff assists in orienting artists from outside the community into the local culture to nurture their understanding of the town by introducing them to the cultural traditions, stories, and values of the community. This program, in turn, helps the artist create authentic works that are representative of the community’s identity and unique cultural heritage.   

By providing opportunities for youth and residents to get involved with community planning, Jackson Hole Public Art is not only creating and commissioning public art for the people for their community, but also is increasing the public’s access, understanding, and investment in public art in their town. With more than a dozen unique prominent public art installations, Jackson Hole Public Art has also positioned the community’s public art collection as an economic driver in terms of cultural tourism. It provides visitors visual clues to the community’s cultural identity with an authentic experience unique to the town.","United States"

Since 1971 Allied Arts has raised more than $54 million in support for the community’s arts and cultural organizations. It funds 64 agencies whose work impacts more than 1 million people annually.

Similar to other UAFs, Allied Arts employs a cross-sector approach, rallying the community’s corporations, foundations, and residents to support the arts using a combination of persuasive messaging, storytelling, and testimonials that express the transformative power the arts to the local economy. Members of the business community and community at large can then provide support by donating or participating in any number of Allied Arts’ innovative and engaging individual/corporate donors or employee giving programs.

Allied Arts then distributes the funds by way of grants to its 26 core member agencies and other grantees. These organizations represent a diversity of disciplines ranging from the visual arts, theatre, and dance to local arts agencies as well as historical and heritage based organizations. Member agencies include: the Arts Council of Oklahoma City; the Individual Artists of Oklahoma; Oklahoma City Ballet and the Opry Heritage Foundation of Oklahoma.

During its 2014 campaign, Allied Arts raised a record breaking $3.5 million, the most the organization has ever raised in its 44 year history. Jennifer Hidalgo Bryan, Allied Arts’ Campaign and Grants Director, credits the work of their member agencies and the surrounding community saying, “We are very fortunate to live in a city whose residents understand the impact a dynamic cultural landscape has on economic development and quality of life.” She points out that Allied Arts’ success is directly related to the quality programming, broad community outreach, and innovative educational experiences provided by its member agencies and grantees.  The campaign’s success is also rooted in strong partnerships with the business community. Jennifer underscores that, “corporate support validates the credibility of any nonprofit, demonstrating to the general public that the nonprofit does meaningful work and is worthy of financial and volunteer support.” 

So what are some tips Allied Arts offers arts organizations forging partnerships with the business community?

Ensure that the partnership is a two-way street and always keep businesses informed of the impact they are making.
Offer meaningful opportunities for employee engagement for all the businesses employees.
Provide a service to businesses y helping raise awareness about the city’s robust cultural offerings.
Be open to learning from the expertise and skill sets of business employees and applying some of that learning to the business of the arts.

Through this successful joint community effort, Allied Arts is able to fulfill its goal of ensuring that the arts & cultural groups in their community have the resources they need to remain strong, reach underserved populations, and offer quality programming to the public.

Kristen Bromley, Allied Arts’ Marketing and PR Manager, shares a story of how one student living with his single mother and grandmother had to take the role of being “man of the house” very seriously, but had always dreamed of playing guitar. The family was unsure if that dream could ever be made a reality, but then they found Granville Community Music School. Thanks to the support through Allied Arts, Granville Community Music School offers music lessons for 50 cents to low-income families. Since joining Granville, he has not only learned to play the guitar, but he has also grown into a happy, confident young man. Now he is no longer afraid of speaking in front of crowds, is doing better in school, is making friends and was also accepted into a fine arts charter school. Now, the young man would also like to start teaching beginning guitar to students of his own!

“It is a privilege to represent the needs of our arts organizations and be a part of the incredible work they do every day to enhance the quality of life for those in our city,” says Kristen. “We use stories from the agencies that we fund to show the transformative power of the arts in individual lives and in entire communities.”

In the next five years Allied Arts has a lots of big plans for raising funds and awareness for their work, all aimed at better serving the needs of the cultural community. In addition to increasing donor diversity and effectively integrating technology into fund- and friend-raising, Allied Arts seeks to grow their endowment in order to achieve the long-term goal of fully funding their operations so that 100% of campaign donations can be granted to strengthen the arts in their community.","United States"

"Roseann Weiss","Americans for the Arts is my “go-to” network for information and essential tools about arts in communities. Whether it is Animating Democracy, the Public Art Network, in-depth arts research or strategies for advocacy – I know I can find resources on-line and through their amazing and accessible staff.

"Women & Creativity: Harwood Art Center & Littleglobe","Many people know that March is Women’s History Month, but how many arts organizations succeed in engaging their whole community in the celebration? Every March, two organizations in Albuquerque New Mexico, Harwood Art Center and Littleglobe, do just that. They host a month-long program called Women & Creativity that celebrates women in the arts, science, technology, and other disciplines.

Not only does this program highlight the innovative work of women in the creative fields, it also seeks to strengthen the local community. With 35 local and regional partners and over 70 events, you can find Women & Creativity programming in theaters, galleries, performance spaces, retail businesses, parks, and in neighborhoods throughout Albuquerque. Each year the programming brings together 100 presenters and artists, including many international visual, performing, and teaching artists as well as writers, and creative entrepreneurs.

How does Women & Creativity engage so many collaborators each year? Much of the participation is due to the longstanding expertise and connections of its three co-coordinators: Dr. Shelle Sanchez; Director of Organizational Expansion at the Escuela del Sol & Harwood Art Center, Valerie Martinez; Director of Littleglobe; and Julia Mandeville; Chief Programs Officer at Harwood Art Center. Women & Creativity holds open calls for partners across all disciplines - artists, business coaches, writers, book artists, and many more. Striving to give every woman a voice, the program sometimes directly chooses underrepresented women so they may have a platform to share their stories with the community.

This year’s celebration is particularly special for Women & Creativity as it marks the program’s ten year anniversary. To commemorate this milestone, Women & Creativity has partnered with individuals and organizations throughout the community to organize “Ten for the Tenth,” 10 curated collaborations featuring the work of women across various creative disciplines. The project has introduced new collaborations beyond individual organizations and artist participants such as a 30-day collective exploration, “What Moves You?,” coordinated by the Albuquerque Balloon Museum.  The presentation has united creative efforts from women across industries with interactive exploratory stations from a myriad of different fields.

Women & Creativity has strengthened Albuquerque by providing the community with continued exposure to the arts and organizations with which they may not otherwise have become familiar. Women & Creativity has supported the growth and development of professional relationships between artists and partnering organizations—ninety percent of partnering organizations return each year!  Often these relationships lead to community projects and large-scale collaborations. Artists in particular benefit from the programming, gaining continued promotion.

Over the past ten years, Women & Creativity has continued to have a positive impact on the community, as demonstrated by overall growth in attendance, editorial coverage, website visitation, and social media traction. Since its founding 10 years ago, Woman & Creativity has featured at least one-thousand presenters and artists. 

So, where is Women & Creativity heading in the future? The program will continue focus on strengthening their local community, but founder Dr. Shelle Sanchez says there are plans to broaden and expand future collaborations to a regional or national level. Sanchez notes, “Our coordinating team has ideas and sparks of vision about the next decade, but our success to date has been built on collaboration and collective work. Those same things will be our starting points to move forward.”","United States"

Americans for the Arts has been my go to resource for many years and I encourage every artist and arts and cultural organization to join. The data, research, publications and staff expertise provided are invaluable, having contributed to my development as an arts professional in general, and as an arts advocate at home.

"Shreveport Regional Arts Council (SRAC): Shreveport Common","Restore and refurbish historic buildings; spur the sale of redeveloped properties by public and private developers; revitalize the area with engaging works of public art and dynamic urban green spaces; reinvigorate the transportation system; attract locals and visitors to the area with nationally renowned artists and groundbreaking arts programming; encourage mutually beneficial cross sector collaborations; and finally encourage businesses to relocate to the area.

In short, a lot. These are just some of the things Shreveport Regional Arts Council (SRAC) and the City of Shreveport accomplished with Shreveport Common: an arts-led, multi-partner initiative designed to revitalize a historic nine-block area located within an existing cultural district in downtown Shreveport, Louisiana.  But what’s even more amazing about the effort undertaken by SRAC and the City is that it successfully involved the community at every step of the process. Thirty public and private partners, including existing neighbors, property owners, businesses, and local non-profit organizations and some 1,100 local artists developed the project, from vision planning to actualization. Integrating the community into the planning and implementation of Shreveport Common ensured buy-in, sustainability, and support. Using the arts as a lens to create a cultural community, SRAC and the City focused on nine areas they could revamp, such as parks, transportation, development, and public art.

Since 2010, Shreveport Common’s partners have completed $38 million of the $100 million public/private initiatives planned, including major restoration and preservation projects of historic buildings and places. One hundred local and national acclaimed artists have already performed/exhibited in the area and more than 47 arts events have been organized, attracting thousands of audiences to the area. Developers have purchased 19 buildings, building occupation is up 27 percent, and with visitors, bicyclists, and families exploring the area pedestrian traffic is up.

By placing the arts and artists at the forefront of every redevelopment effort and involving the community, Shreveport Common has become recognized as one of the leading examples of creative placemaking in the country.","United States"

"Rebecca Burrell","After I received a scholarship to attend my first Americans for the Arts Convention in 2012, my world rapidly began to shift. In San Antonio, I learned about the local Emerging Leader (EL) networks, and I immediately went on to help found the EL network in Portland. I then ran for a seat on Americans for the Art’s Emerging Leader Council, an experience that has allowed me to help design and present at the Leadership Preconference, sit on the host committee for NAMP 2013, and mobilize EL networks in other states.

Being part of the community at Americans for the Arts also allowed me to contribute a recent blog post about The Right Brain Initiative, the arts education program I work for, which earned our organization major attention from colleagues in the field.

Perhaps most importantly, my affiliation with Americans for the Arts has helped me see myself as a leader for the first time. I’ve been able to contextualize and ascribe value to the unique contributions I’m already making to the field. I’ve become connected to inspiring, challenging, and extremely smart people throughout the nation. These folks drive me to do better work, and I hope I get to work with them for the rest of my career. There is simply no monetary value that can be placed upon that.","United States"

"Landmarks Public Art Program","Landmarks is the public art program of the University of Texas at Austin. The program commissions and features artwork by contemporary artists from around the world on the university’s campus and is recognized for its community building through public art outreach.
 
Landmarks was launched as a program of the College of Fine Arts in 2008.  The aim of the program was to develop a professionally curated public art collection to be featured around the university’s campus. The first works to appear in the collection were 28 sculptures from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, chosen because they fit the artistic theme the university wanted to convey. Since then, the program has flourished and much of the works are integrated into the curricula to educate the students on the style of the artworks and about the artists. The program offers students and visitors the opportunity to engage with different artworks to educate the community about the arts.

More than 350 acres of land serves as a public classroom for students and professors at the University. The Preservation Guild, for example, allows the students to learn about the maintenance and care of the works. Students can also take part in the docent program and provide tours to visitors for the opportunity to sharpen their communication and analytical skills. 

Current and upcoming projects commissioned by Landmarks demonstrate major trends in the visual arts and feature diverse media. In September 2010, the University commissioned David Ellis’ piece, Animal, as the first video in the public art collection. Animal is a nine-and–a-half minute clip that exemplifies the Department of Art & Art History’s commitment to the presentation of new forms of visual art. Ellis was chosen for his work celebrating and inviting collaborative processes.
 
Other upcoming projects include Marc Quinn’s Spiral of the Galaxy, a large conch shell to be located near the entrance of the University’s new Dell Medical School. The shell was selected for the medical school for its symbolism as a complex structure that protects delicate organisms, and should be completed fall 2016. This addition to the University’s collection exemplifies Landmarks’ mission and goal of intertwining public space with contemporary art. Landmarks also features other forms of art such as poetry to complement the works around the campus and encourage artistic collaboration among artists from various disciplines. For example, Professor Kurtz Heinzelman from the University’s English department wrote an ode titled “Mutli Ton Dancer” for Mark Di Suvero’s Clock knot, one of the popular monumental sculptures featured in the collection. In the ode, Heinzelman focuses on the dance and movement that the sculpture conveys.Landmarks also provides tours and special events for audiences enabling visitors to experience the vast collection.

The program, which features the works of 35 artists, also provides information about the featured works to help the community enhance their understanding of its collection.","United States"

"Megan Pagado","I discovered and joined Americans for the Arts as an undergraduate student interested in arts management. Americans for the Arts’ services, particularly for emerging arts leaders, have been invaluable in these early stages of my career.

After attending the National Arts Marketing Project Conference and Nancy Hanks Lecture at National Arts Advocacy Day, I took part in the first Local Arts Classroom, where I heard from experts and leaders about creative placemaking, community planning, board and staff development, and other issues. I also currently serve on the steering committee of Emerging Arts Leaders DC, which is part of Americans for the Arts’ Emerging Leaders network.

"Eddie M. Granderson","I’ve been an Americans for the Arts member now for well over a decade. I first experienced the organization as a means to get away from my city, travel to a new city, and meet others interested in the arts. Over the years it has become much more to me.

As leaders in the arts field, Americans for the Arts staff advance topics in the arts and provide platforms for discovery. The organization has shaped and supported my work as a public art administrator by hosting conferences that promote new ideas and expose best practices in the field. Americans for the Arts has helped shape ideas and insights that bridge my passion with practice.

The many relationships and experiences I've had as a member of Americans for the Arts have helped grow my career as an arts administrator. I hope to bring the experience full circle as a new public art network council member supporting Americans for the Arts.","United States"

"Children’s Art & Literacy Festival: Abilene Cultural Affairs Council","So when his original artwork was scheduled to go on exhibit at the National Center for Children’s Illustrated Literature (NCCIL) in Abilene, Texas in 2012, the Abilene Cultural Affairs Council jumped on the opportunity to capitalize on the artist’s popularity.
Collaborating with the NCCIL, which was exhibiting artwork from Seuss’ beloved book, the Lorax, and other downtown arts groups, the Children’s Art & Literacy Festival was born. The festival’s purpose is to highlight the summer artist on exhibit at the NCCIL, to show off Abilene’s arts and cultural attractions, and to foster a love of reading and creativity in children.

The festival, known as the CALF, takes place the second weekend of June and is aimed at toddlers and youth. The festival has become an instant success and each year grows larger and larger. This year, the festival featured William Joyce. His books inspired the Rolie Polie Olie TV series and the animated Rise of the Guardian and Epic movies. Despite a hail storm the first night and a temporary power outage the second morning, registrations increased 57 percent from the previous year, with nearly 3,000 festival goers in attendance and netting a revenue of around $45,000. People came from 65 cities across Texas and even as far as California to Florida.

The festival has become the region’s largest collaborative event involving hundreds of volunteers who man two and a half days of activities that include a parade, artist talk, book signings, dramatic readings, art activities, train rides, animals, a book making workshop, magic shows and a movie festival at the Historic Paramount Theatre. The activities are held at museums and cultural attractions downtown and involve ten arts groups, including the Abilene Philharmonic Orchestra, which offers an “instrument petting zoo.”

The festivals have left a permanent mark on downtown Abilene and the families who visit. “This is not your typical hot dog and bouncy house kind of festival. It’s truly an enriching experience for families,” says Sidney Levesque, Director of Marketing at the Abilene Cultural Affairs Council.  “We had the sweetest story from a mom whose son was struggling with reading when the school year ended and wasn’t interested in books. He attended the festival and was eager to go to the dramatic reading and other activities. He got so excited that he insisted on buying William Joyce books with his own money and is now reading them cover to cover. The mom was so grateful for the festival turning her son’s attitude around and instilling a love of reading.”

Lynn Barnett, Abilene Cultural Affairs Council executive director, says her goal is for Abilene to become the storybook capital of America.

“Celebrating children’s literature and art emphasizes Abilene as a family-friendly place to visit and live,” Barnett remarks. “It also draws people to our wonderful attractions downtown and highlights our vibrant arts scene.”
The 2015 Children’s Art & Literacy Festival will feature David Shannon, author and illustrator of the popular books No, David!, How I Became a Pirate, and A Bad Case of the Stripes.","United States"

"Tod A. Kniazuk","It's so easy to only think in the bubble - of a specific community, specific experiences, or specific issues. Being part of Americans for the Arts opens the door to a myriad of new thoughts, ideas, and colleagues. The staff is even available to come to you; my organization Arts Services Initiative of Western New York brought Jay Dick to Buffalo to do advocacy training for our area's cultural leaders. Having access to AFTA's materials and staff is like having a full time researcher in your organization, or like being part of an ongoing class on best practices and emerging trends - all without leaving your office. That said, I'd highly recommend leaving the office to attend the annual AFTA Convention. In just a few days I learn from the best, connect with my peers, and return to Buffalo refreshed and excited to be working in the cultural sector. This year I was even honored to be chosen to present at the convention, and hopefully give a little back as I continue to get so much from AFTA.","United States"

"Artist INC Live: Mid-America Arts Alliance","Mid-America Arts Alliance wanted to take action to empower artists to continue their strong role in the ecology of the creative economy. So they decided to do something new: train artists as entrepreneurs. To this end, Mid-America Arts Alliance (M-AAA) has entered into a partnership that invests more fully in the lives of the artists who work in their region providing a cutting-edge professional development for artists across six states.

Artist INC Live is an eight-week intensive program designed to provide working artists with the business skills needed to excel in their practice. Once a week for three hours, a small group of 25 artists meet and receive instruction from artist-facilitators and subject matter experts from the local community who impart skills in arts planning, marketing, finance, law, and technology. The program is open to artists working in a range of disciplines and with skill levels ranging from emerging to experienced. Guest lecturers and an intimate classroom setting with ample opportunity for group work are cornerstones of the program so the artist-participants have the opportunity to network with their peers and explore the practical applications of the lessons.“It’s a very intensive and rewarding program” says Mary Kennedy, Executive Director of M-AAA. “The eight-week structure allows the artists to absorb and incorporate the lessons into their practice. The fact that artists teach the program is also a strength, because it creates a network for both the facilitators and the artists enrolled in the program. The networking becomes a tremendous resource in their career and fulfills the artists’ desire to connect with other artists working in different disciplines.”

First launched in 2009, Artist INC Live is an outgrowth of research initially undertaken by Arts KC and the Charlotte Street Foundation in 2007, aimed at gaining a better understanding of the needs of artists in the Kansas City region. When it was discovered that the artists in the community desired business skills, the partnership expanded to include the University of Missouri-Kansas City’s Innovation Center. Program Director Diane Scott was hired to conduct a feasibility study for developing such a program in the KC community.  After conducting extensive research on similar professional development programs across the country, Scott found that as successful as those programs had been, none offered a replicable or defined curriculum. “What’s novel about Artist INC Live is that it has longevity.” Scott remarks, “We have developed the entire curriculum so that it’s replicable anywhere. We don’t have to go into other communities to run this program; instead we train the facilitators and they return to their hometowns to run their own sessions of Artist INC Live.“  

At the time of its launch the program was available exclusively to Kansas City artists, but it was so successful among artist-participants that demand for the program soon grew beyond the City limits. The program has since expanded to include an online workshop (which is available to artists across the country), free one-day workshops, strategic counseling sessions and an advanced level course “Artist INC II” for continuing artists. Since the program launched in 2009 “Artist INC Live” has served an estimated 400+ artists in the Kansas City region. When M-AAA joined the partnership in 2013, it extended the reach of the in-person workshop “Artist INC Live” to more than 200 additional artists in Little Rock, Arkansas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This year in addition Little Rock and Oklahoma City, the program will expand once more to serve artists in Omaha, Nebraska and Austin, Texas.","United States"

"Vicki Scuri","I value being a member of Americans for the Arts because it promotes arts-community awareness and creates a platform for discussion and connection. I especially enjoy browsing the listservs to learn what topics are of interest to arts professionals across the U.S. The Listservs are a great resource for all kinds of information. One can engage actively in dialogue or passively follow conversations. Both are engaging and informative. Also, I enjoy attending the AFTA conferences, especially the Public Art Network pre-conferences. These conferences allow one to connect names and faces, to meet new colleagues and to become informed about the arts locally and globally. I enjoyed the recent conference in Pittsburgh, especially the local performing arts and the variety of discussion groups, workshops and social events.  Americans for the Arts is a great umbrella for all the arts and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to be a member of this group.","United States"

"Letitia Fernandez Ivins","As a member of the Emerging Leaders Council from 2009 to 2012, I had the opportunity to serve my colleagues while reaping the benefits of building and serving a national network, experimenting with new methods of service including audience and content development, event planning and presenting not to mention the requisite commiseration and merry-making. Those three years were transformative.

This period was punctuated when I was asked by Americans for the Arts to moderate a closing panel discussion at last year’s Convention. I was honored and anxious. I had never moderated a panel, let alone before 250+ peers and senior public art leaders. But I was struck by Americans for the Arts trust in my ability and inspired by this affirmation of their commitment to next generation leadership. We had an honest and energetic discussion about the range of career trajectories that make our workforce so textured and nimble. We were called to become “guerilla bureaucrats” and to sharpen our senses and leverage artists in order to draw out naturally occurring creative energy in communities. For me, the experience was incredibly gratifying- I was given the space to flow! However, more significantly the challenge gave me a confidence boost when I needed it the most, before I checked out for a few months to have my second baby. It renewed my commitment to culture work and paved the way for an enthusiastic return to the job!","United States"

"Arts Council of Kanawha Valley","What is a fledgling Arts Council to do when almost every artist asks if grants will be given out? You start searching the web and social media for ideas about how other communities have answered this question.That's what Arts Council of Kanawha Valley did eventually stumbling across the site SundaySoup.org, an international grass roots initiative for feeding the creative community – literally and monetarily.   Most of the events featured on the site had donated food, e.g. soup or pasta, requested a minimal entry fee, open mic for creative projects and simple voting system.   While the community was enjoying the food, artists were pitching their ideas and then the audience voted for their favorite project.

This idea was brilliant. It was a natural fit for the organization to get arts community buy-in, introduce themselves to a wide variety of audiences and work with local businesses.   Since most of the events on Sunday Soup had names similar to food, such as FEAST, Grub, Stir, Stock – some were acronym such as CAFE ,“Creative Arts Funding Endeavor” - they came up with Square Meal.  It was decided that Square Meal would happen at local restaurants with 4 artists presenting for 4-8 minutes, reservations were $16 ($10 grant money, $5 for the food and $1 for us) and winners had 8 months to complete the proposal goals and had to submit a 4 minute video as a final report. Being the quirky, creative arts organization, that they are, they got a kick out of breaking the program down into multipliers of 4 and decided to run with it for this program.

Restaurants loved the idea and had no problem with the low-ball of $5 a head for food.  Some have used this to try out new menu items.   Sponsors helped the council start the grant pool at $200+ rather than $0.

As part of Kanawha Valley's organizational goals, it was decided that they would introduce a formal Call for Proposals.  Giving priority to artists, arts groups and creative projects and second priority to community development proposals.  Proposals had to answer 4 criteria:

Project Description: 150 word summary of project while being as specific and tangible as possible.  (These were included in press releases, social media and read aloud for the introduction.)
Relevance/Need: Why is this project important now? What is the project’s historical, personal and contextual background? What will happen if you don’t get funding? Is this feasible? Have you done a similar project?
Use of Funds: How will you specifically spend the money if you are funded? Do you have other partners?
Timeline and Final Report: When will the project be complete? How will you know it’s successful? How will you evaluate its success?
Call for Proposals are released about 4 weeks from the scheduled event. After received, proposals are blind carbon-copied emailed to a panel of 5 jurors.  The jurors represented all genres of arts and ranged from professors, patrons or working artists.  Jurors rated the proposals using a rubric and invitations to present were sent to the 4 highest totals. 

Audience members are encouraged on the ballot to donate additional funding for presenters regardless of winning.  Several have received use of hotel points, donation of equipment, purchase of specific supplies or offer of cooking meals for film crew.

Since the program was started almost 3 years ago, projects funded have included:  High School World Music Percussion Ensemble to purchase a trailer for performances and travel, purchase of decent projector and screen to show free Art films weekly at a local art gallery/bookstore, funding for props and model fees for a local chapter of Dr. Sketchy’s Anti-Art School, purchase of a pug mill (clay recycling machine) for local pottery cooperative, funding for upcoming visual art exhibit, purchase of fabric for Teddy Bears for Police Departments, theatrical production to raise awareness of domestic violence, funding for Montessori school play about the Cycle of Life using lights, and funding to help start a Low-Power FM radio.

Connecting the community to the artists is the outcome of this crowd funding model.  It truly leaves a lasting impression on the audience members, gives opportunity to meet artists, gives creative individuals a platform to share their ideas and leaves everyone with fuzzy feel-goods and a better community.","United States"

"Childsplay","For 36 years, Childsplay has remained  at the forefront of arts education in Arizona schools—transforming the academic experience for thousands of Arizona students so much so that students have come to recognize the company, its teachings, and shows as part of their traditional academic experiences.

Childsplay was founded by David Saar in 1977 with the belief that children could reap great benefits from experiences with professional theater. Since then, Childsplay has become an internationally respected, award-winning professional theater company, focused on children’s theater and arts education. Childsplay serves an average audience of 200,000 students, families, and teachers each year. Its season includes several local touring productions, a national touring production, and a series of in-house productions at the Tempe Center for the Arts.

The local touring productions, which visit hundreds of schools throughout the state, are the mainstay of the organization and continue a tradition started by Saar and his colleagues in 1964. Childsplay touring productions are so well known, it’s estimated that one in five Arizona students, K-6, has seen a production. This number stands as testament to the reach Childsplay’s touring productions has had in the state where much of its audience lives in rural communities at or below the poverty level. In addition to Childsplay’s productions, the company also hosts an array of educational programming at the Tempe Center for the Arts; programs include a theater academy throughout the year, summer classes, and a conservatory for more serious theater students. The company also partners with school districts to offer afterschool programming. 

Childsplay’s touring theater season and educational programming aren’t the only features of the company that make it Arizona’s leader in arts education; Childsplay also offers arts education resources in more than 40 communities every year. These opportunities take the form of artists’ residencies, facilitated by professional teaching artists, and professional development workshops for teachers.","United States"

"C.R.E. Outreach","theater company Outreach has launched Heroes' Stories, programming for war veterans to honor and empower our country's brave service members. In partnership with New Directions at its local Veterans’ Affairs office, the program gives vets a safe outlet to voice their own heroic experiences and stories.

Stands for create, reflect, and empower, and the organization uses theatre to enhance self-esteem, encourage self-expression and empower individuals to overcome the challenges in their lives. Next up for is a groundbreaking musical called Beyond Sight, which tells the story of U.S. soldier Jack Carter, whose life is forever changed when he is blinded during combat in Afghanistan. Upon his return, he is forced to face the challenges of reintegrating back into society without his vision.

Beyond Sight is so much more than a musical - it is a project that hopes will raise awareness about the struggles of our nation’s service members and garner support for these brave men and women as they return to civilian life.

According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, there are more than 2.3 million soldiers who have served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. One out of four of these soldiers returns with a service-related disability. In addition to physical injuries, many veterans also suffer from emotional and psychological conditions including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, guilt, and depression. Far too often, these individuals don’t receive adequate care and support to address these issues. Beyond Sight is an empowering story of hope and courage meant to prove that these individuals are not defined by their disabilities and can live successful and fulfilling lives.

Development for Beyond Sight began three years ago when C.R.E. Outreach’s acting troupe, Theatre by the Blind, in partnership with the Braille Institute of Los Angeles, presented a production focused on the challenges of disabilities in military families. Then, in June 2013, Outreach brought another production, Which Direction, to a stage at the Veterans’ Affairs office in Los Angeles—an original production that depicts the amazing untold stories of a group of military veterans. Their stories and real accounts of war on the front lines inspired to begin production on Beyond Sight. Subsequent interviews with veterans lead to a script that realistically portrays military lives and experiences in authentic detail. One of the keys to authenticity for this new production will be Beyond Sight’s casting of military veterans and blind actors in key roles.

The show will premiere in Los Angeles in spring 2014. However, after the premiere, Outreach hopes to have Beyond Sight tour the nation, spreading this important message to everyone. One of the vets that C.R.E. works with summarizes why projects like Beyond Sight are so significant:

The last 12 years have taken a toll on all of us. For some, the scars are obvious, and for others they are hidden but still there. All of us come back changed, some of us more than others. I think this project is great because it will help remind people that these changes are lifelong. My biggest fear is that as the war ends in the next year and the American public's attention moves to something else, the numerous Vet support efforts that have sprung up will die, and soldiers like Jack, will be forgotten. Projects like this can help people to remember.","United States"

"Outreach is not the only arts organization working with returning veterans. The military has identified four areas as critical to the success and preparedness of our troops: Readiness, Resiliency, Retention, and Reintegration.

"Eastern Michigan University’s Arts Management Program","Students enrolled in Eastern Michigan University’s (EMU) Arts Management Programs (Undergraduate & Graduate) produce two-day music festivals, art competitions, face and body paint tailgating activities, art crawl events, and reality TV shows as part of an academic service learning project and student organizational activity designed to give members their first experiences as arts administrators.

The Arts Management Project (AMP) is a yearly project undertaken by students of the Arts Management program at EMU. The project, which doubles as a student organization, produces arts-based events and creates opportunities for EMU’s student artists to present their talents to the campus community. 

Previous events organized by AMP include the AMP Music Fest, a two day event, featuring The Hard Lessons, a Detroit based band, and more than 20 student bands;  a face & body paint tailgate activity, organized during the week of homecoming; Art Crawl, art opening featuring student work organized at an off-campus gallery; and more recently Clash of the Creators, their filmed reality TV competition. 

AMP events have become well-received since their first production almost six years ago. In 2013, the organization was nominated for an award for its commitment and positive contributions to the campus community. AMP is not only AMPlifying the Arts (the organization’s tagline) on the campus community, but also achieving its mission of connecting EMU student artists with audiences, venues, and opportunities to empower them to transform their creative practices into careers.

AMP provides its student members with field experience and serves as a professional network. Members learn firsthand what it’s like to market, plan, and fundraise for events. Students also learn how to manage projects, forge partnerships, manage budgets, and work with artists. They often travel to association conferences and are kept abreast of events and other local professional development opportunities.

Membership to AMP is open to all EMU students, and governed by an eight-member board and faculty advisor. In the spring of 2013, AMP’s President was presented with the Gold Medallion Award for “Outstanding Leadership by a Student” during a ceremony hosted by the Division of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. AMP (the organization) and the faculty advisor were also nominated for awards.","United States"

"Kickstart Disability Arts & Culture","Putting Disability Arts on the BC cultural map

In 1997, a small group of artists and advocates with disabilities got together in Vancouver to talk about bringing disability arts to British Columbia. Key among them were filmmaker Bonnie Sherr Klein and disability activist Catherine Frazee. Inspired by a growing international disability arts movement, and by Canadian disability activist Catherine Frazee’s urging to find “both pleasure and politics in disability culture.” Among those gathered were two artists whose lives already exemplified that call – filmmaker Bonnie Klein, and sculptor/dancer Geoffrey McMurchy. As Bonnie Klein put it: “Living with disability is an art. Our various and unique disabilities compel us to create innovative paths around obstacles. In both content and form, we are taking risks that only we can take.”

They continued to meet, and by 1998, the first disability arts organization in Canada was born. Registered as the Society for Disability Arts and Culture (S4DAC), the nonprofit society’s goals were simple, but not easy: to support and promote artists with disabilities and to present disability arts festivals to BC audiences. The fledgling group pledged to present “authentic non-sentimental expressions of the disability experience,” to include all artistic disciplines, and to welcome all disabilities. People with disabilities were to comprise at least 50 percent of the board of directors. These have remained the organization’s guiding goals and principles through almost 20 years of building disability arts in Canada.

Mission

Kickstart’s mission is to produce and present works by artists with disabilities and to promote artistic excellence among artists with disabilities working in a variety of disciplines.

Mandate

Kickstart Disability Arts and Culture (formerly the Society for Disability Arts and Culture) was incorporated November 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

to encourage and support artists to create and present authentic interpretations of the disability experience;

to provide opportunities for the development and advancement of artists with disabilities; and
