brief history:

aanmitaagzi has grown from a convergence of the personal and professional histories of its core members, while remaining true to the initial vision of its co-founders, penny couchie and sid bobb. when penny and sid moved to penny's ancestral home of nipissing first nation in 2006, they welcomed the possibility of living and working as professional artists to support a thriving arts community in nipissing and the surrounding communities. they recognized the benefits of developing and maintaining relationships and partnerships with like-minded groups, and the potential for nipissing to become a home for research, development, and the creation of new works in dance, theatre, and cross-disciplinary arts with both professional and community artists.


following the success of their first community engaged arts project, stories of nipissing, and with positive feedback and support from the community, penny and sid formed the aanmitaagzi collective with carol guppy and perry mcleod shabogeesic in 2008. in 2009, after conducting strategic outreach in bear island / temagami, sherry guppy and bonnie couchie also joined the company. identifying the need for a strong organizational foundation for the future of the company, aanmitaagzi sought out capacity building initiatives, including a mentorship in organizational development with ruth howard of jumblies theatre funded through the oac compass program and canada council for the arts' capacity building program. aanmitaagzi incorporated as a provincial, not-for-profit organization in october 2010, and continues to engage the local community through multi-disciplinary and multi-generational arts activities and cultural events."

fairy tales adds a dynamic flare to calgary's cultural offerings while improving upon the city's national and international reputation as an accepting destination, having a positive impact on residents of calgary and on tourism. the fairy tales presentation society is best known for our annual fairy tales queer film festival, celebrating films made by and/or about the lgbttqa and queer communities. since 1999, the festival has attracted over 14,000 patrons. we present over 25 entertaining and thought provoking films of all genres that otherwise may not be presented in calgary. our innovative programming ensures that film leaps from the screen to the lived experience, through panels, q&as; and other related events. we show local, national and international work with opportunities for filmmakers, audiences and emerging audiences to engage, network and grow.



fairy tales also delivers the year-round outreels diversity education program. outreels provides diversity education to the communities around calgary by using filmmaking and other art forms as educational vehicles. screenings have included: miscellaneous youth group, queers on campus, alliance to end violence, calgary public library (fish creek, central and louise reily branches), hillhurst united church, and st. stephen's anglican church. outreels features films that generate conversations on topics such as bullying, the intersection between religion and sexuality, queer history and the global struggle for human rights worldwide.



in 2011, fairy tales also launched two new programs: q the arts, and the youth queer media program (yqmp). the yqmp mentors youth in creating a first film, video or animation addressing issues faced by queer youth today. each year, yqmp work is elegible to be selected as part of the yqmp screening gala, held as part of the annual fairy tales queer film festival anually. q the arts began as an annual festival event at the arrata centre in march 2011, showcasing queer artists through performance, music, spoken word, and visual arts. the program has developed into our community partnership program, where we join forces with other organizations throughout the year to present exciting cinematic and queer focused events."
