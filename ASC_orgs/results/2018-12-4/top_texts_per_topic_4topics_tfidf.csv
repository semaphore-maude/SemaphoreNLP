we are always looking for support in audience development, publicity, and outreach, to maximize and expand our organizational breadth and impact. hyp currently offers youth-led in-school residency programming to secondary schools and middle schools in the greater hamilton area through a curriculum-approved workshop series appropriate for elementary age to university students. 

our monthly poetry slams happen every 4th sunday of the month from june - april at the spice factory, 121 hughson st n. entry is $5 for audiences and performers and there is both an open mic component and competitive opportunity in the conventional format of a poetry slam (standard rules apply.)



our saturday spitfire writers' series, free community workshops offered at 126 james st n every saturday, just wrapped up its twelve-week season. we will be offering these workshops again in the fall - hamilton beat is an exploration of verse journalism, investigative poetry, and poetry for social change, with new assignments each week; check the method is an exploration of different mediums of poetry and the multi-faceted face of the ""slam"" poem, new work produced each week; emcee wreckshop is an emceeing and beat making ""hip-hop university"" workshop series with included recording and production time of an original song for each participant. further details on the next launch of these programs can be found on our website and social media once that information is available. https://www.instagram.com/hamiltonyouthpoets/"

founded in 2014 by matt white and carin lowerison, green light arts is a not-for-profit theatre company based in waterloo region. our mission is to create and produce entertaining, challenging, and unique theatre experiences that engage and inspire audiences to make the world a better place. we strive to cultivate a relevant artistic voice in contemporary society and use theatre as the beginning of a conversation to encourage audiences towards positive social change.



our goals

to present well-crafted, bold, challenging plays from canada and around the world;

to uphold the professional theatre industry through rigorous practice and high-calibre work;

to make theatre accessible to all, regardless of ability or socio-economic status;

to celebrate and reflect diversity and inclusion in our work of different cultures, genders, ages, abilities, sexual orientations, education, class and beliefs;

to use theatre as means of encouraging collaboration, enhancing confidence and emboldening imagination through enriching educational programs for youth; our programming model includes presenting, producing plays, and developing new work. to date, we have produced 15 theatrical projects, including 7 original projects, a play commission, 2 canadian premieres, a theatre series, 4 presentations of previously produced projects, and a benefit performance.



our current arts education programs include: 

1. pd day play-in-a-day program (ages 6 to 13) - a full day of free theatre and play-building taking place in various neighbourhoods on each of the professional development days of the waterloo region district school board calendar year. 

2. the neighbourhood project (ages 14 to 18) - a free after-school program working with youth in under-served communities to develop a play about their neighbourhood; and

3. student matinees and workshops in high schools.



our outreach and community engagement framework is called fuel. through fuel we offer free public ancillary events and activities to stimulate community discussion around societal themes that are explored in our current theatrical projects.



fuel events are curated for positive community impact and inclusion and feature field experts including artists, psychologists, social workers, scientists, philosophers, and community leaders. fuel events include workshops, lectures, exhibitions, podcasts, and gatherings. we work often and closely with community partners and aim to be receptive to the causes that community partners are already furthering and ask how we can augment their work through theatre. green light arts is an affiliate member of the professional association of canadian theatres(pact)."
